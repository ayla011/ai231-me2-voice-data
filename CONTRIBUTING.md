# Contributing your recordings

Takes about 20-30 minutes for the full prompt list (62 prompts x 2
approved takes = 124 approved clips at 5s each). You can retry a take as
many times as you want before approving it — only approved takes count.

## 0. Prerequisites

- *Some* Python 3 (any recent version) and `git` — that's genuinely it.
  `setup.py` handles the rest, including finding a Python 3.10+
  interpreter on your system automatically if the one you have isn't
  new enough (`pywhispercpp`, used for live transcription, requires
  3.10+ and fails to even import on 3.9 and older).
- A working microphone, in as quiet a room as you can manage

No compiler, cmake, or manual whisper.cpp build needed — see step 2.

## 1. Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/ayla011/ai231-me2-voice-data.git
cd ai231-me2-voice-data
```

## 2. Set up (one-time)

```
python3 setup.py     # macOS/Linux
python setup.py      # Windows
```

This builds its own `.venv` in this folder (searching your system for a
3.10+ Python first if the one that ran this script is too old), installs
`requirements.txt` into it, and pre-downloads the default whisper model
(`base.en`, ~140MB) so your first recording session doesn't stall on a
download. Windows, macOS, and Linux all just work — the whisper binary
comes prebuilt inside the `pywhispercpp` package. Safe to re-run; it
reuses `.venv` if it's already there and looks fine.

If it can't find any Python 3.10+ anywhere, it'll tell you and point you
to https://python.org/downloads/ (or `brew install python@3.12` on
macOS) — install one and re-run.

## 3. Record, transcribe, judge, approve

Run with `.venv`'s own python directly, so there's no dependence on your
shell's PATH:

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/record.py --speaker-id <yourid>            # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\record.py --speaker-id <yourid>    # Windows
```

(Or `source .venv/bin/activate` / `.venv\Scripts\activate` once, then
just `python scripts/record.py ...` for the rest of the session.)

Use the `speaker_id` convention your group agreed on (see
`docs/drive_folder_structure.md`) — it becomes both your output folder
name and your Drive folder name, so get it right the first time.

For each prompt, one take at a time:

1. It prints the prompt. Press Enter, speak within the recording window.
2. whisper.cpp transcribes what it heard and shows it next to the
   expected text (with a rough WER, just as a hint).
3. You decide: `Enter` = keep this take, `r` = retry, `p` = play it back
   first, `s` = skip this prompt, `q` = stop (safe to resume later).

Nothing gets written to `manifest.csv` or saved as a `.wav` until you
press `Enter` to keep it — so **by the time a take is saved, you've
already approved it**. There's no separate validation pass; what you
upload is what's used.

For the numeric/time prompts (`TIMER`, `ALARM`, `TEMPERATURE`,
`BRIGHTNESS`), don't be surprised if whisper's transcript looks
"different" even when your recording is fine — it often writes "20%"
for spoken "20 percent". Trust your ear (use `p` to play it back) over
the WER number; the transcript is there to catch actual
silence/mumbles/misreads, not to gate on exact string matches.

Options:
- `--approved-takes 3` — how many approved recordings you want per
  prompt (default 2)
- `--labels TIMER ALARM` — only record specific intents (default: all)
- `--resume` — skip prompts that already have enough approved takes in
  your manifest (to redo a specific one anyway, delete its row from
  `manifest.csv` and its `.wav` first, then run with `--resume`)
- `--model small.en` — use a bigger/more accurate whisper model instead
  of the default `base.en` (auto-downloaded on first use)

## 4. Upload

Once you're through the list, upload your entire `recordings/<yourid>/`
folder to the shared Drive, following `docs/drive_folder_structure.md`
exactly (folder name = your `speaker_id`). Don't commit recordings to
this git repo — see `.gitignore`; audio lives on Drive only.
